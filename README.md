🎯 Guess the Number Game

Guess the Number is a simple interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. With each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

🧠 How It Works

    The computer randomly selects a number (e.g., between 1 and 100).

    The player is prompted to guess the number.

    After each guess, the program tells the player if the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

    The game continues until the player guesses correctly (or reaches a maximum number of attempts, if implemented).
